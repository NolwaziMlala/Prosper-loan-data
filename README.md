## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I only focused on the original loan amount and Prosper ratingâ€”aspects that may have an impact on the borrower APR. I began by displaying the borrower APR distribution. I then demonstrated the correlation between APR and rating as well as APR and Prosper Score. I also looked into how rating affected how APR and rating related to one another.
